I created this calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was from my initial web development projects when I was learning front-end development. It's so cool to see you, how you started from the basics, and now you are going to the next level. I have used JS internally in my HTML and not made a seprate file so that's why it's not showing on my github repo.
